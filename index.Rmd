## Hypothesis 

English Gothic literature from the 18th and 19th century contains a substantial amount of references to Christian theology, and these references play a vital role in the ideation of the concept of horror employed by Gothic fiction.

## Corpus Description

We collected twelve novels categorized as gothic literature to constitute our corpus. Each novel was composed by a different author; the aim was to represent multiple voices of the time, and capture a multitude of ideas that came to represent the Gothic imagination. The novels were chosen at random, with the intention to avoid selection bias that could compromise the analysis. The corpus is a product of writings from the 18th and 19th century - the choice to include works from the two centuries in a corpus was made so that we could assess if a shift occurred over time in terms of how, and to what magnitude, Christian theology was embedded in English Gothic literature.

## Summary 

We chose Gothic literature as it was a genre we were not well acquainted with. We only had a cursory understanding of it and expected to find the usual suspects: grotesque violence, haunted castles, and people succumbing to insanity. Much to our surprise, we found mentions of god and Christianity, along with metaphorical uses of religious terminology. This led us to wonder if religious concepts existed only in the periphery, or if they were constituent of ideations of horror and terror that lay at the heart of Gothic literature. We decided to investigate this question by employing various gothic novels from the 18th and 19th centuries as our corpus. 

# Tools 
## Frequency comparison:

When analyzing the list of terms sorted in descending order of frequency, we observed that the words ‘convent’, ‘heaven’, and ‘soul’ appeared within the first 200 terms. This provided us with the initial thrust in our research, as these words confirmed that Christian theology was indeed at play in Gothic literature. We then set out to examine the frequency and usage of terms and phrases pertaining to religion, particularly Christianity.

We chose two pairs of words that were the most fundamental and basic concepts in Christianity: ‘virtue’ and ‘sin’, and ‘heaven’ and ‘hell’. Upon plotting the frequency graph, we found that these pairs were not only present in our entire corpus, but they also had a high frequency correlation throughout the 18th and early 19th century texts.

The positive results from this rudimentary analysis propelled us to dig deeper. We wanted to see where the frequency of these basic concepts of Christianity stood in relation to the basic terminology of Gothic literature. For this purpose, we picked the three most frequently occurring words that represented the Gothic imagination in our corpus: ‘terror’, ‘horror’, and ‘blood’.

The result was deeply satisfying. Although, at various points, the frequency of the terms of gore was an order of magnitude higher than terms of Christian theology, this was to be expected because these terms are nouns and adjectives, and are employed much more frequently to set the tone and atmosphere of the novels. However, the difference in relative frequency between the two categories was not pronounced enough to demerit our hypothesis.

At this point we decided to perform a more granular analysis. We settled on the list of the seven deadly sins and seven virtues — core concepts in Christian theology. The sins encompass pride, greed, lust, wrath, envy, sloth, and gluttony. The virtues include chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness, and humility. The sins were combined into one cluster, and the virtues into another.

The results surprised us yet again. We found that the relative frequencies of the two aforementioned clusters were not insignificant when compared to our cluster of the three most frequent Gothic terms. Thus, our hypothesis passed our test of granularity.

The cumulation of these findings proved that Christian theology, indeed, was embedded in the English Gothic literature of the 18th and 19th century. Next, we wanted to find the context in which theology was employed, and its role in the conception of horror.
